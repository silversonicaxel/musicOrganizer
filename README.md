# musicOrganizer
Music Organizer is an application that arranges the file and directory structure of your own music library. 
Once chosen the music repository directory and set a source directory, the application, which expects correct tags for each song, according informations like Artist, Year, Album, Title, moves and renames these files in the repository, following a precise logic.
Python was used to create the application, WxPython libraries to manage the graphics and Mutagen module to get tags, according the mime/type of every song.


## Note

The problem is that WxPython is only available on the Mac in 32-bit mode so it is necessary to run Python in 32-bit mode for the newer versions of operating system.
